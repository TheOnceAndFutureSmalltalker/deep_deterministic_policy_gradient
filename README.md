# Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient Project

This project uses a Deep deterministic Policy Gradient to estimating the optimum policy for a double jointed arm trying to keep its hand within a small distance of a moving target.  The agent receives a rewaqrd of 0.1 for each timestep that its hand is close to the target.  The goal of the project is to train the agent sufficiently so that it maintains an average score of 30 over 100 episodes.
